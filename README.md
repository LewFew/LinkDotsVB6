# LinkDotsVB6
Place down dots, then connect them dealing damage. Made in VB6
The reason this is created in visual basic 6 with me going through the trouble of implementing a pseudo object oriented design is that the
restrictions of my ICS4U culminating makes me do so. Specifically, the fact that it needs to be done in VB6. If you're worried about plagiarism
as this project is on github, don't be. This culminating project is specific to me.
